In the beginning I started digging deeper into the world of HHVM to see if we could run topLog using HHVM, and if so, what the performance be like. I have come across some challenges that led me to write this article.

topLog has two main components; we are using Laravel as our framework for the UI side of things and we have our proprietary topLog engine sitting in the back-end that makes all the magic happen and it is being called from front-end.

####**A Little Background on HHVM**
[HHVM](http://hhvm.com/) is an open-source virtual machine developed by Facebook for executing programs in PHP and their own programming language Hack. HHVM compiles PHP into an intermediate bytecode, then translates it into x64 machine code dynamically at runtime using a just-in-time compiler.

explain the diagram a little 

####**Installing HHVM using Vagrant Box - Ubuntu 12.04**
This is a very straightforward and inelegant way to install hhvm but it works if you just want to try outg the hhvm in a quick and dirty way. Here I am using the prebuilt package for Ubuntu 12.04 . You can just put this code in your Vagrantfile within configuration. For different prebuilt packages of Ubuntu or different Linux distro's you can [check out this link](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/Prebuilt%20Packages%20for%20HHVM) and modify the code snippet for your Vagrantfile accordingly.

		config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-shell
			sudo apt-get update
			sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common python-software-properties --fix-missing
			sudo apt-get update
			sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:mapnik/boost
			sudo apt-get update
			sudo apt-get install -y libboost1.49-dev libboost-regex1.49-dev \
			  libboost-system1.49-dev libboost-program-options1.49-dev \
			  libboost-filesystem1.49-dev libboost-thread1.49-dev
			wget -O - http://dl.hhvm.com/conf/hhvm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
			echo deb http://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu precise main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hhvm.list
			sudo apt-get update
			sudo apt-get install -y hhvm
  		shell

After our box is up running, here is the first thing to do to see if HHVM was installed correctly:
	
	$ hhvm --version

You can php files just  like the original PHP itself. You can create a hello world php file and run it using the command:
		
	$ hhvm helloWorld.php
	
There are also couple of useful commands:

	$ sudo /usr/bin/update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/php php /usr/bin/hhvm 60
 
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/hhvm restart

####**Puppet**
If you are using puppet to deploy your vagrant-managed virtual machines,
there are a few repos that include hhvm that you can potentially learn from:

https://github.com/adyromantika/vagrant-hhvm
https://github.com/craigcarnell/puppet-hhvm

Also [PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com/) is a pretty cool website that gives you a GUI to set up a virtual machine from scratch. (with HHVM too, of course)


####**Compiling the backend**

We have a file called php.list that contains the paths and names of the php files we want to compile into bytecode.

in the directory where that file is located , run this command

    hhvm --hphp -thhbc -o /path/to/hhvm.hhbc --input-list /path/to/php.list

This command will compile the php files into bytecode and store it in a database created in the folder specified. In this case, we should have /path/to/database/hhvm.hhbc 

####**Configuration**

After our box is up and our code is compiled, we need to create a configuration file config.hdf in /etc/hhvm/ folder and paste this:

	Repo {
	  Central {
	    Authoritative = true
	    Path = /path/to/hhvm.hhbc
	  }
	}


A common implementation of JIT compilation is to first have AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation to bytecode (virtual machine code), known as bytecode compilation, and then have JIT compilation to machine code (dynamic compilation), rather than interpretation of the bytecode - put this where appropriate
